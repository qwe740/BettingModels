Now we will get advanced stats from a different API endpoint and add it into our games dataframe\n\n#### This will serve as the basis of the model\n\nUltimately, the starting thesis for how we will

ball consistently (stopping moving the ball for defense)\nExplosiveness - How good is a team at generating/preventing explosive/game changing plays\nTurnovers - The turnover margin is highly predictive in who will win. We can say this is potentially random, but it is important and may be a key trend for some teams. So, we will let the model use it as a feature. \n\nFor EPA, Success Rate, and Explosiveness, we look at offense and defense, but we will also include it broken out by rushing plays and passing plays for one view, and standard Downs and passing downs for another view. \n\nFor EPA, we will also look at EPA margin (offense - defense) to show how a team is overall as an aggregate of their offense and defense. This doesn't work for success and explosiveness, so this will not be considered for now. \n\nNone of these statistics are opponent adjusted, so I hypothesize that the model might overvalue teams with easy Strength of Schedule. We will test it this way first, however, if it is not highly successful, I will add another layer into all of this to opponent adjust all key advanced stats that the model takes as input, to ensure strenght of schedule is well accounted for.
